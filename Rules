Go Fish — Rules (Person 5 Variant)

Deck and Deal:
- Standard 52-card deck.
- 2 players: deal 7 cards each.
- 3–4 players: deal 5 cards each.

Turn:
- Ask a specific opponent for all cards of a rank you hold.
- If they have any, they must give them and you take another turn.
- If not, say "Go fish" and draw the top card from the deck.
  - If drawn card matches asked rank, you continue; otherwise turn ends.

Books:
- Collect all four cards of a rank -> a book (1 point).
- Remove those four from the hand and place in score pile.

Empty Hands:
- If a player's hand becomes empty and the deck still has cards, draw up to 4 cards (or as many as remain).

AI Behavior:
- AI selects a random rank uniformly from the ranks it currently holds.
- AI chooses opponents externally (not part of this simplified module).

Edge cases:
- Drawing from an empty deck returns no card (no effect).
- Game ends when all 13 books are formed or when deck and all hands are empty.
